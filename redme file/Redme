Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
1. Requirement Analysis
Gathering and analyzing user requirements to ensure the application meets their needs for data collection and reporting.

2. Design
Creating a clear structure for the program, including functions for collecting user data, calculating totals, categorizing requests, and generating reports.

3. Implementation
Writing clean and maintainable code, ensuring each function has a single responsibility, which enhances readability and facilitates debugging.

4. Testing
Implementing input validation to handle user errors and ensuring that all functionalities work as intended, including data collection and calculations.

5. Deployment
Packaging the application for easy access, allowing users to run the program without additional setup.

6. Maintenance
Regularly updating the code to fix bugs, improve features, and adapt to user feedback.
